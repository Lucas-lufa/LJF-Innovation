1. List two brainstorming techniques to generate ideas.

One brainstorming technique is mind mapping, where ideas are visually organised around a cental concept. This method records creative thinking by allowing branching off with related ideas and then because is there it can be engaged with and explored more. It is particularly useful because the ideas and connection are recorded you can put all of your effort into generating new ideas. Another useful aspect is breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. Star bursting technique is like mind map except you aim to be more specific by answering questions like who, what, when, why and how.

2. Discuss techniques to identify the suitability of an idea for implementation within a project. How might an idea or possible solution be evaluated?

To determine an idea's suitability for implementation, SWOT analysis and feasibility studies are essential. SWOT analysis helps by identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats related to the idea, offering a clearer view of its alignment with project goals. Feasibility studies delve deeper into assessing practicality by examining cost, technical requirements, team capabilities and the potential returns. In this evaluation, functional and non-functional requirements play a vital role. Functional requirements describe what the system must do, such as performing tasks, processing data, or supporting user communication. Non-functional requirements outline how the system should perform these tasks, focusing on aspects like completing tasks within a specific time frame, ensuring data security at rest and intranet. These comprehensive assessments ensure ideas are both practical and aligned with the projects needs, reducing risks and paving the way for successful implementation.

3. Describe a practical or operational reason a project might not proceed.

Running out of runway is the biggest reason a project might not proceed, there can be many things responsible for this. Perfection is the enemy of the good. Something working is infinitely better than Something not working, no matter how perfect it will be. Trying to make something perfect before it is working will make sure it is never done or done so late it won't be worth while. There are some parts that will need to be as perfect as can be like encryption but you would import the libraries where others have done that work. The other main reason for running out of runway ie time is not prioritising the right parts. You need to look at what parts are needed to make your project work and do them, it is very easy to spend all you time and effort on a feature that is not used.

4. Describe effective methods of evaluating solutions of systems against a business and its objectives.

 User testing is a crucial step in checking if a system meets business goals and user needs. Despite our best efforts to understand what users want, there will always be a differences between what we think and what is real. That's why involving user in te testing process is the best way to close these gaps. Bu asking for and using user feedback during development, we can continuously improve te system to match user expectations and achieve business goals. User feedback helps us make the system easier to use and better for everyone.

 Another method of evaluating solutions is evaluating a system or solution against industry standards this is important for assessing its effectiveness, quality, and compliance. By comparing a system to these standards, businesses can ensure their products  or processes meet expected levels of quality, security, and performance. This boost the system's competitiveness and builds confidence among stakeholders, including customers, partners and regulatory bodies.

 For example, when we implement responsive design into our website, we adhere to accessibility standards 'Web Content Accessibility Guidelines' (WCAG) to make the website inclusive for user with disabilities and keeping up with businesses standards.

5. Describe in your own words two emerging trends or technologies in your field and how they impact it.
 
 One emerging trend is cloud-native development which changes how we create and run applications by focusing on software made for cloud environments. Technologies like microservices, container (like docker ), and serverless computing help developers build flexible and scalable apps. For example, a shopping app can quickly increase resources during busy times to maintain good performance.

 Vector Databases improve how we store and search complex data in large language models and machine learning. These database hold high-dimensional data, like word meanings or image features, which are crucial for recommendations and image recognition. For example, a music streaming service may use a vector database to suggest songs based on similarity rather than keywords. This technology enables developers to create smart applications that quickly find similarities, opening new opportunities in various industries.

6. Identify an existing product or service that would allow this technology or trend to be implemented in a project. (Also provide evidence as links and screenshots of those services)

 These databass provide a new method for managing complex data structures, creating new opportunities for applications such as natural language processing and recommendation systems.

Pinecone is an existing service that uses vector database to allow developers to integrate machine learning models with large-scale data for real-time similarity searches, making it ideal for AI applications like recommendation engines. Pinecone is built to handle large volumes of data and provides fast, accurate searches, which is essential for AI-driven applications.

7. List two example sections that could be included in an action plan document and describe their purpose.

 Monitoring and evaluation metrics. The metrics can assess the project's success in meeting its objectives and identifying areas for improvement. Including User Engagement and Click Through Rate, which track the number of active users, posts, and event registrations can see the effectiveness of the project.

 Legal and Compliance Considerations. This section can be included to address legal, ethical, and compliance requirements related to data security, privacy and usage. For example including Privacy Act 1988 and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ensures our project adheres to local data protection regulations.
