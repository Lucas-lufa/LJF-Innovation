*Aaron: This is great, I like the structure that you've given and it's very clearly laid out. For the gap analysis I've never thought of literally doing a here's where we are, where we want to be set up for each. That said you have actually gone a little too much into detail if anything. But you have it so keep it! :D The solutions choices and comparisons are the "body" of this report. This is context and background stuff to set and refer to. Great work so far though!*

# Solutions report


## Executive summery

## Overview

The Alumni Project is a tool to facilitate community. This will be done through having a channel where past and present students can be in contact, network, organise events and participate. Thing that will flow from it meaningful work opportunities, mentoring and learning opportunities and cross discipline collaboration to counteract the ill effects of solo potentially creating innovation. We will start with a narrow scope of ICT but want to expand to all disciplines TAFE offers.

## Business Objectives (high level â€“ Strategic plan?) 

### For all students

Networking Opportunities 
Have platform for students to connect with peers, alumni, and lectures beyond their course duration, to help professional and personal networking.


Streamline Communication 
A cohesive, easy to use that can be secure communication system. For students to find study groups, access mentorship opportunities, or stay updated on relevant information from NMTAFE.


Alumni Engagement
Have engagement from alumni, for those that are interested giving potential benefits for current students.
 

Giving Back 
Alumni involvement in volunteer or mentorship programs. This will help both parties get a deeper understanding if we are able to facilitate.


Secure Alumni Database
Accurate and complete alumni information to help with effective communication and engagement.

### For new students 

Schedule
Balancing coursework, extracurricular activities, and personal life without established routines or advice. 
 

Study Group Formation 
difficulty finding like-minded peers to form study groups for effective learning. 
 

Making Friends 
Struggling to build social connections and find a sense of belonging.

### Factually

Avenue for feedback
Has potential to get better quality feed back because people could report how things worked out after left but might suffer from small sample size.


Avenue for opportunity
I could be a better way to have opportunities disseminated from industry contact TAFE already has or from alumni.

## Existing software or considerations

The only solutions that is being employed are adhoc social media like linkedin or chat groups. Some ready made solutions are

Desired State
Schedule
Balancing coursework, extracurricular activities, and personal life without established routines or advice. Maybe just linking in with what is there, an extra funnel into existing services.


Current State
Study Group Formation 
difficulty finding like-minded peers to form study groups for effective learning.

Desired State
facilitate to build social connections and find a sense of belonging, while reducing the negative parts of socialising like bulling.


### Factually

Current State
Is good already with lecture culture and the TAFE intuition of soliciting feedback and accepting unsolicited feedback. 

Desired State
Avenue for feedback to feed into what is already there.
Has potential to get better quality feed back because people could report how things worked out after left but might suffer from small sample size.


Current State
can be patchy, I have heard of some people getting job placements and internship but not sure how common it is.

Desired State
Avenue for opportunity
I could be a better way to have opportunities disseminated from industry contact TAFE already has or from alumni.

## Solutions

Alumni need to reach as many people as posable not just where the biggest audiences is on the same hand it needs to be usable not just working. Splitting the project in front, back and data. This should help the project be more maintainable and help it succeed in the long run at no extra effort except some planning. All three parts can be done with bespoke, a framework or with something off the shelf. Practically at our scale the front can be done bespoke or with a framework the back can be done with a framework or off the shelf and the data is really only off the shelf.

local install
ui components
feed or feeds history
posts history
chat history
shared data about groups and people. members and Friends or general?
documents

### Frontend

The frontend needs to be cross platform. Cross platform for computers should just a user interface running in a browser. Mobile can be a user interface running in a browser as well but optimised for mobile either totally bespoke or using a framework specifically React and React Native. Another option for mobile is a cross platforms framework like Flutter.

Alumni need to reach as many people as posable not just where the biggest audiences is. It also needs to be usable not just working. One way to achieve this is to have a web application and applications for all the platforms. Just have a web application with progressive web applications (PWA) for install. Have the frontend done with a framework that has cross platform support.

although this would probability have good results it would be alot of work to do and maintain. We could do web application with progressive web application (PWA) for installation or use a cross platform framework to handle the installation.
The frontend needs to be cross platform doing web and mobile operating systems. 
bespoke, mobile first web app or web app with mobile apps
framework, with cross platforms react, react native and flutter

Frameworks take some over head to learn but that is usually off set by the time taken to implement features that a framework provides. All the frameworks are opinionated and have a particular style, 
this is most notable in the frontend where it is visual.

Bespoke has the potential for the best out come but you need a high skill level, personal developing for each platform, know exactly what is needed or have a lot of time to prototype. High skill and long time can make it expensive, this might be best when the projects know what works and what it exactly needs.

Because it is green field and it will evolve as the project grows it is a lot better to have something that has prioritises prototyping and then deployment on to many platforms.
